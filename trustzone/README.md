# Showcase of Trusted Applications in TrustZone

The Teaclave TrustZone SDK enables developers to build Trusted Applications 
(TAs) in Rust, providing a memory-safe and secure execution environment. 
Many of the examples in the SDK repository are adapted from OP-TEE's 
original C-based examples, demonstrating fundamental security primitives.

With `rust-std` support and access to the broader Rust ecosystem, 
developers can now build more sophisticated logic in TAs, enabling robust 
protection of sensitive data in real-world applications.

This directory presents a curated collection of advanced reference 
implementations using the Teaclave TrustZone SDK. These examples span a 
variety of use cases, such as digital wallets and Web3 DePIN scenarios, 
showcasing how Rust and TrustZone together can secure critical components 
in decentralized systems.

We welcome contributions from developers using the Teaclave TrustZone SDK, 
especially minimal MVPs that demonstrate real use cases and share new 
Trusted Application examples with the community
