# Showcase of SGX Enclaves

The Teaclave SGX SDK enables developers to build enclaves in Rust for IntelÂ® Software Guard Extensions (SGX), offering a memory-safe and enclave-isolated execution environment. 

With full support for rust-std and integration with the Rust ecosystem, developers can implement complex enclave logic in a safe and ergonomic way, protecting sensitive data in practical deployment scenarios.

This directory presents a collection of advanced reference implementations using the Teaclave SGX SDK, covering real-world use cases, showcasing how Rust and SGX together can power secure and trustworthy systems.

We welcome contributions from developers building with the Teaclave SGX SDK, especially sharing minimal MVPs that highlight real use cases with the community.
