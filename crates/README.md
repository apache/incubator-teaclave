# Teaclave Crates

Teaclave Crates contains Rust crates developed by Teaclave contributors. 
These crates are designed to be architecture-agnostic, enabling shared code 
across different Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) hardware.

## Purpose

Teaclave enables the development of Trusted Applications across various TEE 
hardware. Many use cases might have architecture-independent shared code, 
agnostic to the underlying architecture. This directory serves as a 
repository for such Rust crates.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community. If you have a crate that fits 
the purpose of this directory, please refer to our Contributing Guide for 
more information.
